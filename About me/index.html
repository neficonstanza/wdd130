        <p>Hi everyone. Let me introduce myself. I live in El Salvador, Central America. I am married and have a three year old boy. We as family like to always go to the beach and enjoy nature and the beautiful places here in Central America</p>
        <p> I graduated from my first bachelor in Business Management (Finance) in 2020 and I am exited to start my second career in computer programming. Currently, I work as a Settlement Operations Analyst and also teach Excel.</p>
        <p>One of the reasons I decided computer programing is due to my wife. She studies Applied technology and I realized that this field is amazing. I have no experience in this field but I am enthusiastic to learn from it. I look forward to learning and meeting all of you </p>
